# Milestone 1: Following Lines 

## Objectives
The goal of milestone 1 was to have our robot be able to follow a line and also navigate a figure 8 on the grid.

## Following a Line
### Hardware Modifications

INSERT PICTURE OF LINE SENSORS HERE

In order to implement line following, the first step would be to add sensors to detect the line.  We used the provided IR line sensors and attached two the the front of our robot.  

We chose to have two sensors at the front of the robot to read either side of the line as the robot traveled.  This way, the sensors could tell immediately if the robot was off course.  When detecting 

We were careful to have the sensors as close to the ground as possible without interfering with movement in order to have good measurements.  We
