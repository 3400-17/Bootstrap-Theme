# Lab 4: FPGA and Shape Detection
## Teams

**Team 1**: (Arduino) Michael and Siming

**Team 2**: (FPGA) Marcela, Zoe and Natan

## Objectives

* Detect basic shapes froma camera input
* Send camera information to the Arduino


# Arduino Team

Michael and Siming 

### Materials used:
* DEO-Nano FPGA
* Arduino Uno
* OV7670 digital camera

### Goals
The goals for the Arduino team is for wiring the camera, setting up its registers with the Arduino, and reading in treasure data from the FPGA.

### Data Structure for Sending/Receiving FPGA Information


### Communicating with the FPGA
How to encode the what we see in the camera to the Arduino. 
camera connects to GPIO, 8 outputs, feeds straight
a block to strip away bits
a block to detect treasure
