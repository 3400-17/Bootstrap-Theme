## Fourier Transform

Fourier transform is to translate frequency in time domain into frequency domain such that we could analyze the frequencies by directly 
looking at its composition in frequency domain. As it's hard to decompose signals in time domain as several different signals may take plact
at the same time so the value of amplitude is a combination of several amplitudes belonging to differenet signals.
